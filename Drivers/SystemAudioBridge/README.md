# System Audio Bridge

System Audio Bridge is an output-only Core Audio HAL device for macOS 13 and
later. It is DSP-agnostic: any companion application that implements the
versioned transport can consume its PCM stream. Transport protocol version 3
preserves Core Audio client ID, PID, bundle ID, lifecycle, cycle timing, and
separate PCM blocks so the companion can apply per-application processing
before mixing. Each packet also carries its Core Audio channel-layout tag so
semantic roles survive the driver boundary. The current product profile
exposes one 7.1 Float32 LPCM transport endpoint in ITU order
(`L R C LFE Ls Rs Rls Rrs`). It is hidden under the generic
`System Audio Bridge` name while idle and can be made visible under an active
profile name by a companion app. It exposes no input stream and does not use
macOS Microphone privacy APIs. A companion app can also publish per-profile
Core Audio aggregate outputs as inactive selection entries.

The driver is deliberately small. It receives client-scoped interleaved Float32
blocks from Core Audio and copies them into a bounded shared ring. A companion
userspace process reads that ring and may analyze, record, route, or process
the frames with any suitable audio engine.

```

Calls and screen sharing apps can continue to use the real microphone as
their input. Because the virtual device is not an input device, another caller
cannot select it as a microphone and feed remote voices back into the call.

## Build

The scripts use Apple's command-line tools and target macOS 13 by default.

```sh
Drivers/SystemAudioBridge/build-driver.sh
Drivers/SystemAudioBridge/package-driver.sh
```

Generated artifacts are written under `build/driver/`. The driver is ad-hoc
signed and the package is unsigned unless a release pipeline replaces those
development defaults with Developer ID signing and notarization.

For a local system test, build the package and then run:

```sh
Drivers/SystemAudioBridge/install-driver.sh
```

That operation asks for an administrator password, installs only
`/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/CamillaAudio.driver`, and reloads Core Audio.
The corresponding removal script is `uninstall-driver.sh`. Neither operation
is run as part of a normal build.

## LPCM layout contract

The product build uses `SABR_CHANNELS=8`. Development builds may select only
the standard layouts `2`, `6`, or `8`; the driver publishes the matching Core
Audio labels and tags for stereo, 5.1, and 7.1 respectively.

The transport protocol provides:

- interleaved Float32 transport capacity up to 32 channels;
- explicit active-channel count independent of allocated capacity;
- an explicit channel-layout tag on every packet;
- versioned direction, stream ID, and bus index fields;
- monotonic 64-bit ring positions and observable drop/underrun counters;
- standard build settings such as `SABR_CHANNELS=6`.

CamiTune accepts all three layouts and preserves the source roles through its
transport, per-application mixer, metering, and analysis paths. Until the
FrontStageRenderer milestone replaces it, a bounded role-aware stereo fallback
feeds the existing stereo DSP/output path. It passes stereo unchanged, maps
center and surround beds conservatively, and excludes unfiltered LFE from small
full-range speakers.

Future microphone support should be a separate, explicit input stream or
device using `SABR_TRANSPORT_DIRECTION_INPUT`. It will also need its own ring
ownership rules, UI consent, channel layout, clocking tests, and a clear
privacy explanation. Do not advertise an input stream in the output-only
product build: doing so would bring the virtual device back into call-app
microphone lists and could reintroduce feedback.

## Real-time rules

The driver callback does not allocate, lock, open files, log, or call into the
app. File mapping and connection changes occur through a non-real-time custom
Core Audio property. If the app falls behind, the bounded writer counts and
drops new frames instead of blocking Core Audio.
